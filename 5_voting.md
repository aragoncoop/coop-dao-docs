# Voting

### How can we safely minimize voting?

In order to make the cooperative productive it's important for us to come up with processes which minimize how frequently we have to vote on things. The less voting we do, the less time, attention, and transaction fees we impose on other members of the organization. However, we also want to make sure there is oversight and accountability. To accomplish this we should set structures which allow individuals to take actions unilaterally, but impose budgets and consequences such as revoking privileges within the organization in the event that individuals abuse their privileges.
Voting is a democratic vote of members (MBR) that is weighted by their Merit (MRT). Each MBR vote is equal to 1000 MRT votes. Each member can use MRT to gain additional voting power up to 10% of all MRT in circulation. This means that even the most active member of the community will not be able to overrule the crowd. As the organization scales the distribution of MRT will become more and more decentralized.
Being reliant on the MBR member token, this system is also somewhat sybil resistant. Members are the foundation of the organization, and becoming a member requires a vote from current members. MKR can give members additional weight, but nowhere near enough to overpower the majority. This allows for future upgrades such as quadratic voting with the merit token.
