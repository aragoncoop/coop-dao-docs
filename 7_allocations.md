# Allocations

### Sharing is caring.

Not everything that needs to be done within the organization needs a vote or to be turned into a bounty. The allocations app within TPS is designed for weighted payments between multiple parties. We can use this to fairly compensate members for making broad and general contributions which donâ€™t necessarily make sense to create bounties for.
Submitting and commenting on open issues, participating on the forum, or otherwise adding value to the organization should be rewarded. As members see work being done, they can nominate each other for inclusion in a weekly MRT allocation. This allocation is 1/3 of the weekly Coop DAO budget and will be split between those who are nominated. The percentage of the weekly allocation that each nominee receives is weighted by the amount of nominations they received.
