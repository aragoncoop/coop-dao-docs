# Membership
MBR

Membership is the foundation of the Coop. The Coop exists to serve it's members, the broader Aragon community, and DAOs and human coordination at large (in that order). Membership is determined by the MBR token. This is non-transferable. Any Coop member found to be transferring MBR or it's permissions will be removed from the coop immediately.

A MBR token will be minted for every current member of the Coop. New members will need to submit a proposal to join the Coop. MBR token holders will vote on new members regularly (see Voting section). New members should only be added to the Coop if they contribute real tangible value to the organization. Anyone can participate by sharing ideas, submitting proposals, or doing work. Members are the core of the Coop and drive the entire process via governance decisions. As such, members need to be the most engaged and active members of the Coop. Domain specific knowledge, esp dev skills, are also a huge plus as this will greatly enhance the Coops ability to come up with creative ideas, iterate on them quickly, and actually build them.
