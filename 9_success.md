# Success Metrics

### How do we measure and manage the Coop DAO?

> 2/3 participation from Coop members on votes
> 2/3 task proposals completed successfully and on time
> 2/3 positive sentiment in a monthly vote to gather signals on whether or not people are happy with the Coop Workflow. There would be 1 vote for the coop members, and another vote for the broader Aragon community to participate in. This create more engagement with the broader community, ensuring we are on track, creating value, and setting ourselves up for sustainable funding via AGPs.
