### How do we reward and recognize contributions?

Bounties are controlled by MRT holders since you have to do work to earn MRT and MRT is the way we reward work. 
Anyone can create suggestions for tasks along with a bounty for the task. Task proposals will include:
- the problem being solved
- the steps that will be taken to solve the problem
- the time it will take to solve the problem

If a task is larger and requires multiple milestones, those milestones need to be broken into smaller chunks that can be measured on a weekly basis. If this is not possible, a Nest Grant or AGP would be more appropriate. The Coop is for small, fast, dynamic community driven projects that develop iteratively. 

Bounties are set based on a “rate” which is configured globally, so when you fund bounties you fund based on number of hours. When people submit proposals and attach a bounty, they’re really saying X needs to be done and it should take ~Y amount of time to do it. This helps the person proposing a task/bounty to think through the scope of the work, and it also helps the community/reviewer do so as well. People working on projects would also need to provide weekly or montly status reports (kind of like how auturk does) as they work through various milestones.

Reviewers will manage bounties. Anyone can volunteer to be a task reviewer by submitting a proposal explaining why they would make a good task reviewer and the bounty they would require to perform that function

On a recurring monthly basis members can vote on tasks, their bounties, and the reviewers to manage the process.

Reviewers will watch and engage with open/approved tasks and approve their bounties. If a task is incomplete or needs more work the bounty will not be approved and funds will stay in the bounties vault until the bounty is completed. If the task is determined to be too complicated or needs to be removed that can be brought up in the weekly task votes.
