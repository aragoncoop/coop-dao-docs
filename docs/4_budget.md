### How do we make the whole thing sustainable?

In order to make real things happen in the real world, we need to allocate real resources. This means choosing to invest scarce things like time, attention, and capital towards the things we care about. The Coop just got approved in AGP-40 for a 3 month runway. We have 15,600 DAI & 6000 ANT to allocate between May and July of 2019. That's 12 weeks and 1300 DAI and 500 ANT per week. This budget can be allocated between various initiatives on a weekly basis.
The main 2 initiative will be Allocations and Bounties. Allocations are determined by MBR holders and will use the democracy app and bounties are determined by MRT holders and will use the dot voting app. The reasoning behind this is that people doing work and earning bounties/merit are more likely to be engaged in that process and able to assess it's merits, whereas general community members are more likely to be engaged in the broader community oriented efforts and could better recognize the contributions of members.
In addition to budget allocation, we will also mint and allocate Merit (MRT) on a weekly basis. This will be used to reward contributions to the Coop and the successful completion of bounties. MRT can be used to increase one's weight in governance, or can be redeemed for cash (UniSwap/Vault). There will be an initial distribution of 1000 MKR for every current Coop member. After that, 10% of the MRK supply will be minted and allocated on a weekly basis. One can earn MKR via community nominations and the successful completion of bounties. 
(This part I just made up. Is it more or less accurate?)
The majority of funds will be held in a Coop DAO master vault. Every week that week's budget will be moved from the vault (by who?) into a bounties vault or an allocation vault. 
DAI and Merit in the less secure vault can be used to fund bounties, and every member of the organization has the right to allocate funds towards bounties at their individual discretion.
People can request to work on a bounty, and a member of the organization can approve and assign the bounty to the person who requested. The requestor when ready can request funds to be released. To ensure review quality we can assign a few members the reviewer role.
If a member of the organization abuses their privelleges as a reviewer the most damage they could do is drain the low security vault, which should never have more than a weeks worth of funding in it. A member which blantantly abuses this process will be removed from the organization and publicly shamed ðŸ˜¤.
