### How do we fund ongoing work?

If there are some clear roles which we identify that need to be done consistently and we donâ€™t want to rely sporatic nature of volunteers we could consider leveraging the payroll application to provide a consistent stream of funds to specific individuals in exchange for performing specific duties. Changes to payroll will require a vote.
