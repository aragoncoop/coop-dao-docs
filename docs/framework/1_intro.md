### What is the Coop DAO?

The Aragon Cooperative is a community driven organization within Aragon. It's purpose is to support and test out community ideas. This means lots of brainstorming, funding small projects, and iterative experimentation. The goal is to make the community as inclusive as possible, while also being lightweight and fast. We can do this because we're using an Aragon DAO and tools like the Aragon Planning Suite. This allows us to minimize paper pushing and maximize time spent doing cool stuff.
