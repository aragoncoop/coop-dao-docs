### What Is Merit?

Merit is earned directly by accomplishing tasks. Merit is earned indirectly by providing value to the Aragon community and having coop members recognize that and nominate contributions to receive a portion of the weekly allocation.

Members will ultimately be in control of merit, they can both burn and mint merit at their discretion. And Merit will ultimately be in control of membership. This relationship should result in a strong overlap between members and merit. An address must hold merit to create a vote in the membership voting app, and an address must be a member to create a vote in the merit voting app.

Additionally, Merit is used to allocate the organization’s resources and is required to approve transfers from the organization’s main vault.

While MRT is initially transferable, there is a social contract that MRT will stay with Coop members. Gifting MRT to another member is fine, but trading it on open markets is not. Public MRT trading will result in being voted out of the Coop.
